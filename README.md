# Software_Example

An example that illustrates "good" and "bad" software design principles for a group meeting (see [`slides/`](slides/) for the slides).
The examples use [`model.py`](model.py), a 2D QG model hosted [here](https://github.com/joernc/QGModel).

See [`example.ipynb`](example.ipynb) for a "bad" example and [`run.py`](run.py) and [`postprocess.py`](postprocess.py) for "good" examples, making use of the two "utils" modules.
